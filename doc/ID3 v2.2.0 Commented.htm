<h3>Status of this document</h3>

<p class=t>
    This document is an Informal standard and is released so that implementors could have a set standard before the
    formal standard is
    set. The formal standard will use another version number if not identical to what is described in this document. The
    contents in this document may change for clarifications but never for added or altered functionallity.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p class=t>
    The recent gain of popularity for MPEG layer III audio files on the internet forced a standardised way of storing
    information about an
    audio file within itself to determinate its origin and contents.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Today the most accepted way to do this is with the so called ID3 tag, which is simple but very limited and in some
    cases very unsuitable.
    The ID3 tag has very limited space in every field, very limited numbers of fields, not expandable or upgradeable and
    is placed at the
    end of a the file, which is unsuitable for streaming audio. This draft is an attempt to answer these issues with a
    new version of the ID3 tag.

<h3>2. Conventions in this document</h3>

<p class=t>
    In the examples, text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a file. Numbers preceded with $ are
    hexadecimal and numbers
    preceded with % are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x is used to indicate a bit with
    unknown content.
    The most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.
    <br>
    <i>It does show that I have programmed the 68000, doesn't it?</i>
</p>

<p class=t>
    A tag is the whole tag described in this document. A frame is a block of information in the tag. The tag consists of
    a header, frames and
    optional padding. A field is a piece of information; one value, a string etc. A numeric string is a string that
    consists of the
    characters 0-9 only.
</p>

<a name="sec3"> </a>

<h3>3. ID3v2 overview</h3>

<p class=t>
    The two biggest design goals were to be able to implement ID3v2 without disturbing old software too much and that
    ID3v2 should be expandable.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The first criterion is met by the simple fact that the <a href="#mpeg">MPEG</a> decoding software uses a syncsignal,
    embedded in the audiostream, to 'lock on
    to' the audio. Since the ID3v2 tag doesn't contain a valid syncsignal, no software will attempt to play the tag. If,
    for any reason,
    coincidence make a syncsignal appear within the tag it will be taken care of by the 'unsynchronisation scheme'
    described in section 5.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The second criterion has made a more noticeable impact on the design of the ID3v2 tag. It is constructed as a
    container for several
    information blocks, called frames, whose format need not be known to the software that encounters them. At the start
    of every frame there
    is an identifier that explains the frames's format and content, and a size descriptor that allows software to skip
    unknown frames.
</p>

<p class=t>
    If a total revision of the ID3v2 tag should be needed, there is a version number and a size descriptor in the ID3v2
    header.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The ID3 tag described in this document is mainly targeted to files encoded with <a href="#mpeg">MPEG-2 layer I,
    MPEG-2 layer II, MPEG-2 layer III</a> and MPEG-2.5, but may work with other types of encoded audio.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The bitorder in ID3v2 is most significant bit first (MSB). The byteorder in multibyte numbers is most significant
    byte first (e.g. $12345678 would be encoded $12 34 56 78).
</p>

<p class=t>
    It is permitted to include padding after all the final frame (at the end of the ID3 tag), making the size of all the
    frames together
    smaller than the size given in the head of the tag. A possible purpose of this padding is to allow for adding a few
    additional frames or
    enlarge existing frames within the tag without having to rewrite the entire file. The value of the padding bytes
    must be $00.<br>
</p>

<p class=t>
    <i>Padding is good as it increases the write speed when there is already a tag present in a file. If the new tag is
        one byte longer than the previous tag, than the extra byte can be taken from the padding, instead of having to
        shift the entire file one byte.
        Padding is of course bad in that it increases the size of the file, but if the amount of padding is wisely
        chosen (with clustersize in mind), the impact on filesystems will be virtually none. As the contents is $00, it
        is also easy for modems and other transmission
        devices/protocols to compress the padding. Having a $00 filled padding also increases the ability to recover
        erroneous tags.</i>
</p>

<a name="sec3.1"> </a>

<h3>3.1. ID3v2 header</h3>

<p class=t>
    The ID3v2 tag header, which should be the first information in the file, is 10 bytes as follows:
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td nowrap>ID3/file identifier</td><td rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">"ID3"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ID3 version</td><td>$02 00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ID3 flags</td><td>%xx000000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ID3 size</td><td>4 * </td><td>%0xxxxxxx</td></tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p class=t>
    The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3" to indicate that this is an ID3 tag, directly followed by the two
    version bytes. The
    first byte of ID3 version is it's major version, while the second byte is its revision number. All revisions are
    backwards compatible while
    major versions are not. If software with ID3v2 and below support should encounter version three or higher it should
    simply ignore the
    whole tag. Version and revision will never be $FF.
</p>

<p class=t><i>
    In the first draft of ID3v2 the identifier was "TAG", just as in ID3v1. It was later changed to "MP3" as I thought
    of the ID3v2 as the fileheader MP3 had always been missing. When it became appearant than ID3v2 was going towards a
    general purpose audio header the identifier was changed to "ID3".
</i></p>

<p class=t>
    The first bit (bit 7) in the 'ID3 flags' is indicating whether or not <a href="#sec5">unsynchronisation</a> is used;
    a set bit indicates usage.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The second bit (bit 6) is indicating whether or not compression is used; a set bit indicates usage. Since no
    compression scheme has been
    decided yet, the ID3 decoder (for now) should just ignore the entire tag if the compression bit is set.
</p>

<p class=t><i>
    Currently, zlib compression is being considered for the compression, in an effort to stay out of the all-too-common
    marsh of patent trouble. Have a look at the additions draft for the latest developments.
</i></p>

<p class=t>
    The ID3 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the first bit (bit 7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total
    of 28 bits. The zeroed
    bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is represented as $00 00 02 01.
</p>

<p class=t><i>
    We really gave it a second thought several times before we introduced these awkward size descriptions. The reason is
    that we thought it would be even worse to have a file header with no set size (as we wanted to unsynchronise the
    header if there were any false synchronisations in it). An easy way of calculating the tag size is
    A*2^21+B*2^14+C*2^7+D = A*2097152+B*16384+C*128+D, where A is the first byte, B the second, C the third and D the
    fourth byte.
</i></p>

<p class=t>
    The ID3 tag size is the size of the complete tag after unsychronisation, including padding, excluding the header
    (total tag
    size - 10). The reason to use 28 bits (representing up to 256MB) for size description is that we don't want to run
    out of space here.
</p>

<p class=t>
    An ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
    <br>
    Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than $80.
</p>

<a name="sec3.2"> </a>

<h3>3.2. ID3v2 frames overview</h3>

<p class=t>
    The headers of the frames are similar in their construction. They consist of one three character identifier (capital
    A-Z and 0-9) and
    one three byte size field, making a total of six bytes. The header is excluded from the size. Identifiers beginning
    with "X", "Y" and "Z"
    are for experimental use and free for everyone to use. Have in mind that someone else might have used the same
    identifier as you. All
    other identifiers are either used or reserved for future use. <i>This gives us 46656 combinations of frame
    identifiers.
</i></p>

<p class=t>
    The three character frame identifier is followed by a three byte size descriptor, making a total header size of six
    bytes in every frame.
    The size is calculated as framesize excluding frame identifier and size descriptor (frame size - 6).
</p>

<p class=t><i>
    The decision to have a 6 byte frame header was taken in an attempt to balance big frames against little overhead.
    One might think that it's stupid to optimize away a few bytes when the entire MP3-file is soo huge.
    On the other hand I thought it was really cool that most ID3v1 tags, when converted to ID3v2 was smaller than
    before. Size does matter.
</i></p>

<p class=t>
    There is no fixed order of the frames' appearance in the tag, although it is desired that the frames are arranged in
    order of significance
    concerning the recognition of the file. <i>The reason for this is to make it faster to search for a specific file by
    scanning the ID3v2 tags; an intelligent parser wouldn't have to keep reading the entire tag after having found that
    the file isn't the one being looked for.</i>
    An example of such order: <a href="#ufi">UFI</a>, <a href="#mci">MCI</a>, <a href="#tt2">TT2</a> ...<br>
</p>

<p class=t>
    A tag must contain at least one frame. A frame must be at least 1 byte big, excluding the 6-byte header.
</p>

<p class=t>
    If nothing else is said, a string is represented as <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a>
    characters in the range $20 - $FF. All <a href="#unicode">unicode</a> strings
    use 16-bit unicode 2.0 (ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993, UCS-2). All numeric strings are always encoded as <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a>.
    Terminated strings
    are terminated with $00 if encoded with <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a> and $00 00 if
    encoded as unicode. If nothing else is said, newline characters are forbidden. In <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a>,
    a new line is represented, when allowed, with
    $0A only. Frames that allow different types of text encoding have a text encoding description byte directly after
    the frame size. If
    <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a> is used this byte should be $00, if <a href="#unicode">unicode</a> is used it
    should be $01.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The three byte language field is used to describe the language of the frame's content, according to <a
        href="#iso639-2">ISO-639-2</a>.<br>
    <i>ISO-639-1 is not used since its supported languages are just a subset of those in ISO-639-2.</i>
</p>

<p class=t>
    All <a href="#url">URL</a>s may be relative, e.g. "picture.png", "../doc.txt".
</p>

<p class=t>
    If a frame is longer than it should be, e.g. having more fields than specified in this document, that indicates that
    additions to the
    frame have been made in a later version of the ID3 standard. This is reflected by the revision number in the header
    of the tag.<br>
    <i>This allows us to fix our mistakes as well as introducing new features in the already existing frames.

<h3>4.1. Unique file identifier</h3>

<p class=t>
    This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a database that may contain more information
    relevant to the content.
    Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all frames begin with a null-terminated string
    with a <a href="#url">URL</a> containing an
    email address, or a link to a location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
    responsible for this specific
    database implementation. Questions regarding the database should be sent to the indicated email address. The <a
        href="#url">URL</a> should not be used for
    the actual database queries. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' the whole frame should be ignored,
    and preferably be
    removed. The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier, which may be up to 64 bytes. <i>As it is
    desired to identify a file as quickly as possible, it is therefore in our interest to limit the size of frames
    without information value for everyone. Besides, with 64 bytes you can have 1.34E154 combinations. That's many
    combinations.</i> There may be more than one
    "UFI" frame in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.

<h3>4.2. Text information frames</h3>

<p class=t>
    The text information frames are the most important frames, containing information like artist, album and more. There
    may only be one text
    information frame of its kind in an tag. If the textstring is followed by a termination ($00 (00)) all the following
    information should be
    ignored and not be displayed. <i>This could be used to implement new features in the future.</i> All the text
    information frames have the following format:
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td nowrap>Text information identifier</td><td rowspan=4>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">"T00" - "TZZ" ,

<p class=t><i>Initially there was only one text information frame called "TID" (Text Information Data or somthing
    equally boring). It begun with three bytes of flags, indicating which strings were present and which weren't. Then
    all the indicated present strings would follow as null terminated string in the same order as the flags.</i></p>

    The content type, which previously (in <a href="#seca">ID3v1.1</a>) was
    stored as a one byte numeric value only, is now a numeric string. You
    may use one or several of the types as ID3v1.1 did or, since the
    category list would be impossible to maintain with accurate and up to
    date categories, define your own.<br>
    References to the ID3v1 genres can be made by, as first byte, enter
    "(" followed by a number from the <a href="#seca.3">genres list</a> and
    ended with a ")" character. This is optionally followed by a
    refinement, e.g. "(21)" or "(4)Eurodisco". Several references can be
    made in the same frame, e.g. "(51)(39)". If the refinement should
    begin with a "(" character it should be replaced with "((", e.g. "((I
    can figure out any genre)" or "(55)((I think...)". The following new
    content types is defined in ID3v2 and is implemented in the same way

    The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the recording(/source of sound) which the audio in
    the file is taken from. <i>My personal opinion is that this frame should be used for the name of the first album

<h3>4.7. MPEG location lookup table</h3>

<p class=t><i>The author of NAD once planned to make a mp3 encoder of his own, ARCAM. He would at the same time
    introduce a new file format were all the major problems with MP3 was built away, eg. the lack of ability to jump
    precisely within the audio. Thanks for the idea.</i></p>

<p class=t>
    To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a <a href="#mpeg">MPEG</a> audio
    file, frames with timecodes in different locations in the file might
    be useful. The ID3 frame includes references that the software can use
    to calculate positions in the file. After the frame header is a
    descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should increase for every
    reference. If this value is two then the first reference points out
    the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th frame, the 3rd reference
    the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the 'bytes between reference' and
    'milliseconds between reference' points out bytes and milliseconds
    respectively.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
    defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
    between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
    a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
    deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
    'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
    in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
    milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only be
    one "MLL" frame in each tag.
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td>Location lookup table</td><td rowspan=7>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">"MLL"</td></tr>

<h3>4.8. Synced tempo codes</h3>

<p class=t>
    For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece this
    frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing which time stamp format should be used. Then
    follows one or more tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time part. The tempo is in BPM
    described with one or two bytes. If the first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added to the
    first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time
    period, which is not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one single beat-stroke followed
    by a beat-free period.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may
    indicate this for the player. All tempo descriptors should be sorted in chronological order. The first beat-stroke
    in a time-period is at the same time as the beat description occurs. There may only be one "STC" frame in each tag.

    $02 &nbsp; Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
</p>

<p class=t><i>Different time stamp formats were introduced very late in the ID3v2 draft. Initially the time stamp was
    relative, containing the number of MPEG frames from the previous stamp. This was changed for two different reasons.
    One was that some developers didn't want the "SLT" frame to store its timestamps in a chronological order, making
    relative time stamps unsuitable.
    After some discussion it was agreed that the order should remain chronological, but that the timestamps should be
    absolute. Agree is perhaps not the best word since Alon Gingold made his own lyrics format (as a successor to
    lyrics3). I wanted the possibility to increase the amount of bits used for the absolute time stamp (in case one
    should encounter an MP3 file longer than 1500 days) so I added a byte telling that.
    By now Dave Walton begun to push his idea that the ID3v2 should be more of a multi purpose audio format so a new non
    MP3 based timestamp was introduced (increasing accuracy to 1/1000 second, but limiting the maximal length of an MP3
    file to 49 days). The 'used bit' field was redesigned to become a time stamp indicator field. All timestamps in the
    draft were then replaced with this general-purpose solution.</i></p>


<p class=t>Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the beginning of the file.</p>

<p class=t>
    The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
    unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
    syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
    the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
    denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
    following structure:
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td nowrap>Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)</td><td rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sync identifier (terminator to above string)</td><td width="100%">$00 (00)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Time stamp</td><td>$xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p class=t>
    The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
    located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps should
    be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered as a
    validator of the subsequent string.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Newline characters are allowed in all "SLT" frames and should be used
    after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type
    $03 - $04.
</p>

<p class=t>
    A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
    separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
    occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
    valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
    not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
    should be before the sync).
</p>

<p class=t>An example: The "<a href="#ult">ULT</a>" passage</p>

<p class=ind>"Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"</p>

<p class=t>
    would be "SLT" encoded as:
</p>

<p class=ind>
    "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
    " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
    xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx
</p>

<p class=t>
    There may be more than one "SLT" frame in each tag, but only one with
    the same language and content descriptor.

<h3>4.11. Comments</h3>

<p class=t>
    This frame replaces the old 30-character comment field in ID3v1. It
    consists of a frame head followed by encoding, language and content
    descriptors and is ended with the actual comment as a text string.
    Newline characters are allowed in the comment text string. There may
    be more than one comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same
    language and content descriptor.

<p class=t><i>I'm a bit annoyed that this frame turned out almost identical to the "ULT" frame, but I guess that this is

    This frame is often the right answear to all the mails I get asking "Where should I put information xxxxx?"

<h3>4.12. Relative volume adjustment</h3>

<p class=t>
    This is a more subjective function than the previous ones. It allows
    the user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on
    each channel while the file is played. The purpose is to be able to
    align all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to
    change the volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance
    adjust the audio. If the volume peak levels are known then this could
    be described with the 'Peak volume right' and 'Peak volume left'
    field. If Peakvolume is not known these fields could be left zeroed
    or completely omitted. There may only be one "RVA" frame in each
    tag.
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td>Relative volume adjustment</td><td rowspan=8>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">"RVA"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Frame size</td><td>$xx xx xx</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Increment/decrement</td><td>%000000xx</td></tr>
        <tr><td nowrap>Bits used for volume description</td><td>$xx</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Relative volume change, right</td><td>$xx xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Relative volume change, left</td><td>$xx xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Peak volume right</td><td>$xx xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Peak volume left</td><td>$xx xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p class=t>
    In the increment/decrement field bit 0 is used to indicate the right
    channel and bit 1 is used to indicate the left channel. 1 is
    increment and 0 is decrement.
</p>

<p class=t>
    The 'bits used for volume description' field is normally $10 (16 bits)
    for <a href="#mpeg">MPEG 2 layer I, II and III</a> and MPEG 2.5. This value may not be
    $00. The volume is always represented with whole bytes, padded in the
    beginning (highest bits) when 'bits used for volume description' is
    not a multiple of eight.
</p>

<a name="equ"> </a>
<a name="sec4.13"> </a>

<h3>4.13. Equalisation</h3>

<p class=t>
    This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
    predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may only
    be one "EQU" frame in each tag.
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td>Equalisation</td><td rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">"EQU"</td></tr>

        <tr><td nowrap>Adjustment bits</td><td>$xx</td></tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p class=t>
    The 'adjustment bits' field defines the number of bits used for
    representation of the adjustment. This is normally $10 (16 bits) for
    <a href="#mpeg">MPEG 2 layer I, II and III</a> and MPEG 2.5. This value may not be $00.
</p>

<p class=t>
    This is followed by 2 bytes + ('adjustment bits' rounded up to the
    nearest byte) for every equalisation band in the following format,
    giving a frequency range of 0 - 32767Hz. <i>Brian Stucker is the mind behind this data format. It's way better then
    the fix frequencies that the first draft had.</i>
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td>Increment/decrement</td><td rowspan=3>&nbsp;</td><td width="100%">%x (MSB of the Frequency)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Frequency</td><td>(lower 15 bits)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Adjustment</td><td>$xx (xx ...)</td></tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p class=t>
    The increment/decrement bit is 1 for increment and 0 for decrement.
    The equalisation bands should be ordered increasingly with reference
    to frequency. All frequencies don't have to be declared. Adjustments
    with the value $00 should be omitted. A frequency should only be
    described once in the frame.
</p>

<a name="rev"> </a>
<a name="sec4.14"> </a>

<h3>4.14. Reverb</h3>

<p class=t>
    Yet another subjective one. You may here adjust echoes of different
    kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce in ms.
    Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should be
    made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the amount
    of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00 is 0%,
    $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
    reduction on the first bounce, yet 50% on the second and so on. Left
    to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the left
    speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to be
    played in the right speaker.
</p>

<p class=t>
    'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
    right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
    'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left. Setting
    both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the reverb is
    applied symmetric). There may only be one "REV" frame in each tag.
</p>

<p><center>

<p class=t><i>While it says here that the "REV" frame is $00000C big, it might be bigger when encountered. If this frame
    is updated in a later version of ID3v2, that information will be put at the end of the frame and the length
    updated.</i></p>

<h3>4.15. Attached picture</h3>

<p class=t>
    This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
    Image format is preferably "<a href="#png">PNG</a>" or "<a href="#jfif">JPG</a>". <i>Since JPG has the best lossy
    compression and PNG the best lossless compression and both are free I don't see much room for other formats. I
    didn't want to forbid other formats though, since there might pop up better ones in the future. Some people will
    probably think it is neat with ICO pictures as well.</i> Description
    is a short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
    textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
    but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
    each in their individual "PIC" frame, but only one with the same
    content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
    type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is a
    possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'image
    format' "--&gt;" and having a complete URL instead of picture data. The
    use of linked files should however be used restrictively since there
    is the risk of separation of files.

<h3>4.16. General encapsulated object</h3>

<p class=t>
    In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
    'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows '<a href="#mime">MIME type</a>' and 'Filename' for
    the encapsulated object, both represented as terminated strings
    encoded with <a href="#iso8859">ISO 8859-1</a>. The filename is case sensitive. Then follows
    a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'. The
    last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two strings
    may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is always
    an <a href="#iso8859">ISO-8859-1</a> text string. There may be more than one "GEO" frame in
    each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

<h3>4.17. Play counter</h3>

<p class=t>
    This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
    played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
    play. There may only be one "CNT" frame in each tag. When the counter
    reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the counter thus
    making the counter eight bits bigger. The counter must be at least
    32-bits long to begin with. <i>Dirk Mahoney and I once had a debate whether or not the counter should be virtually
    infinite. He said that a simple 32 bit word was big enough and easy enough to implement while I said it wasn't cool
    enough. He's now using the same bat against me when I say that there is no need for two bytes to describe how many
    channels a PCM sample has.</i>

<h3>4.18. Popularimeter</h3>

<p class=t>
    The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
    Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
    playlist that features better audiofiles more often than others or it
    could be used to profile a persons taste and find other 'good' files
    by comparing people's profiles. The frame is very simple. It contains
    the email address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play
    counter, intended to be increased with one for every time the file is
    played. The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where
    1 is worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is
    wanted it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one
    byte is inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter
    eight bits bigger in the same away as the <a href="#cnt">play counter</a>.
    There may be more than one "POP" frame in each tag, but only one with
    the same email address.

<h3>4.19. Recommended buffer size</h3>

<p class=t>
    Sometimes the server from which a audio file is streamed is aware of
    transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
    audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
    recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
    flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
    maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audiostream.
    In such case the tag should reside between two <a href="#mpeg">MPEG frames</a>, if the audio is <a
        href="#mpeg">MPEG</a> encoded. If the
    position of the next tag is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used.
    The offset is calculated from the end of tag in which this frame
    resides to the first byte of the header in the next. This field may be
    omitted. Embedded tags is currently not recommended since this could render
    unpredictable behaviour from present software/hardware. The 'Buffer
    size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one "BUF" frame
    in each tag.
</p>

<p class=t><i>This frame was really designed to make it possible to include ID3v2 tags in the audio stream. In order to
    get the player to play without interruptions when the tag is coming instead of audio data there must be a way to
    tell the maximum size of the tag. A good practice might be to set the recommended buffer size to at least the size
    of the largest tag occurring in the rest of the mpeg stream.</i></p>

<h3>4.20. Encrypted meta frame</h3>

<p class=t>
    This frame contains one or more encrypted frames. This enables
    protection of copyrighted information such as pictures and text, that
    people might want to pay extra for. Since standardisation of such an
    encryption scheme is beyond this document, all "CRM" frames begin with
    a terminated string with a <a href="#url">URL</a> containing an email address, or a link
    to a location where an email adress can be found, that belongs to the
    organisation responsible for this specific encrypted meta frame.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Questions regarding the encrypted frame should be sent to the
    indicated email address. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame
    size', the whole frame should be ignored, and preferably be removed.
    The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by a short content description
    and explanation as to why it's encrypted. After the
    'content/explanation' description, the actual encrypted block follows.
</p>

<p class=t>
    When an ID3v2 decoder encounters a "CRM" frame, it should send the
    datablock to the 'plugin' with the corresponding 'owner identifier'
    and expect to receive either a datablock with one or several ID3v2
    frames after each other or an error. There may be more than one "CRM"
    frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'owner identifier'.

<h3>4.21. Audio encryption</h3>

<p class=t>
    This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
    whom. Since standardisation of such encrypion scheme is beyond this
    document, all "CRA" frames begin with a terminated string with a
    URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
    email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
    responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
    regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
    specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
    audiofile indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
    useless.
</p>

<p class=t>
    After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
    audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
    described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should be
    left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
    datablock required for decryption of the audio. There may be more than
    one "CRA" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
    identifier'.

<h3>4.22. Linked information</h3>

<p class=t>
    To keep space waste as low as possible this frame may be used to link information from another ID3v2 tag that might
    reside in another audio
    file or alone in a binary file. It is recommended that this method is only used when the files are stored on a
    CD-ROM or other circumstances
    when the risk of file seperation is low. The frame contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be
    linked into this tag, a
    URL [URL] field, where a reference to the file where the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed. Data
    should be retrieved
    from the first tag found in the file to which this link points. There may be more than one "LNK" frame in a tag, but
    only one with the same
    contents. A linked frame is to be considered as part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it was a
    physical part of the tag
    (i.e. only one "<a href="#rev">REV</a>" frame allowed, whether it's linked or not).
</p>

<p class=t><i>This is a very nice frame when dealing with tag streaming since it allows the reciever to decide if he/she
    wants to download the frame or not. Since the file is being streamed, it is most likely that the user will be able
    to get the resource, should he/she want to.</i></p>

</p>

<p class=t>
    The "<a href="#com">COM</a>", "<a href="#slt">SLT</a>" and "<a href="#ult">ULT</a>" frames may be linked with three
    bytes of language descriptor directly followed by a content descriptor as
    additional ID data.

<h3>5. The 'unsynchronisation scheme'</h3>

<p class=t><i>The unsynchronisation scheme was initially very, very complex (and had another name, since it didn't
    unsynchronise) and was done very late compared to the other key components of ID3v2. The idea was that all data
    falsely recognized as an MPEG frame (i e the ID3v2 tag) that a player found should have an incorrect CRC and thus be
    skipped. At first, this sounded simple to implement since the CRC would most likely not be correct anyhow. The
    problem was that the correct bit must be cleared so that the player really believed that there should be a CRC.
    If, when unsynchronising, it turns out that the CRC was valid after all, the data had to be manipulated to render
    the CRC erroneous again. The real trick was to reverse the process so that a tag with several MPEG frames with
    unvalid CRC:s should become a normal tag again. By now I made a simple test and found out that most players don't
    care about whether the CRC is correct or not; they play the data anyway.</i></p>

<p class=t>
    The only purpose of the 'unsychronisation scheme' is to make the ID3v2 tag as compatible as possible with existing
    software. There is no use
    in 'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed by new software. Unsynchronisation may only be made
    with <a href="#mpeg">MPEG 2 layer I, II and III</a> and MPEG 2.5 files.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed byte is inserted after the first false
    synchronisation byte. The
    format of a correct sync that should be altered by ID3 encoders is as follows:
</p>

<p class=ind>
    %11111111 111xxxxx
</p>

<p class=t>
    And should be replaced with:
</p>

<p class=ind>
    %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx
</p>

<p class=t>
    This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be altered, so they won't be affected by the decoding
    process. Therefore
    all the $FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the $FF 00 00 combination during the unsynchonisation.
</p>

<p class=t>
    To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the first bit in 'ID3 flags' should be set. This bit should only be set
    if the tag
    contained a, now corrected, false synchronisation. The bit should only be clear if the tag does not contain any
    false synchronisations.
</p>

<p class=t>
    Do bear in mind, that if a compression scheme is used by the encoder, the unsyncronisation scheme should be applied
    <b>afterwards</b>. When
    decoding a compressed, 'unsyncronised' file, the 'unsyncronisation scheme' should be parsed first, compression
    afterwards.

<p class=t>
    ID3-Tag Specification V1.1 (12 dec 1997) by <a href="mailto:amiga2@info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de">Michael Mutschler</a>,
    edited for space and clarity reasons.
</p>

<p class=t><i>
    This section is of little or no concern to ID3v2 implementions, it is here mainly for historical reference. The
    genre section (A.3.) is used bye the "TCO" frame though.
</i></p>

<a name="seca.1"> </a>

<h3>A.1. Overview</h3>

<p class=t>
    The ID3-Tag is an information field for MPEG Layer 3 audio files. Since a standalone MP3 doesn't provide a method of
    storing other
    information than those directly needed for replay reasons, the ID3-tag was invented by Eric Kemp in 1996.
</p>

<p class=t>
    A revision from ID3v1 to ID3v1.1 was made by <a href="mailto:amiga2@info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de">Michael
    Mutschler</a> to support <a href="#seca.4">track number information</a>.
</p>

<a name="seca.2"> </a>

<h3>A.2. ID3v1 Implementation</h3>

<p class=t>
    The Information is stored in the last 128 bytes of an MP3. The Tag has got the following fields, and the offsets
    given here, are from 0-127.
</p>

<p><center>
    <table border=0>
        <tr><td>Field</td><td rowspan=8></td><td>Length</td><td rowspan=8></td><td align=center>Offsets</td><td

    length are padded with zero-bytes.</p>

<h3>A.4. Track addition - ID3v1.1</h3>

<p class=t>
    In ID3v1.1, <a href="mailto:amiga2@info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de">Michael Mutschler</a> revised the specification of
    the
    comment field in order to implement the track number. The new format of the comment field is a 28 character string
    followed by a mandatory
    null ($00) character and the original album tracknumber stored as an unsigned byte-size integer. In such cases where
    the 29th byte is not
    the null character or when the 30th is a null character, the tracknumber is to be considered undefined.
